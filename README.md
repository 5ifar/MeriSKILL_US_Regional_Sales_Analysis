## About the Dataset:
The original raw dataset spans from 1 January 2019 to 1 January 2020 and includes information about product sales, quantities, revenue and geographic data. It contains only 1 table with 10 columns and 1,85,950 rows.

The data was later normalized into 3 tables - fact_Sales, dim_Product & dim_Location during project implementation. The cleaned dataset has - fact_Sales (1,85,950 rows), dim_Product (19 rows) & dim_Location (1,40,787 rows). Addional dim_Date table was created which has 365 rows.

Data Overview: Year: 2019, Months: 12, Products: 19, States: 8, Cities: 9 & Addresses: 1,40,787.

ROCCC Evaluation:
- Reliability: LOW - The raw dataset is created and updated by MeriSKILL. It has only 1 file.
- Originality: MED - First party provider (MeriSKILL)
- Comprehensiveness: LOW - Only 1 CSV File was provided. Dataset contains few parameters for Products & Location.
- Current: LOW - Dataset was created on 2019, almost 5 years old. So its very obsolete & not very relevant.
- Citation: LOW - No official citation/reference available.

## Analysis Insights:
Key findings from data trend analysis constitute insights into product preferences, sales trends, and regional variations. The Sales data revealed a significant spike in sales figures during December, which can be potentially attributed to the festive season.

**I. Top Cities by Revenue:**

- **San Francisco** (8.3M $) leads in revenue, possibly due to the in demand tech market and higher consumer spending power in the Silicon Valley.
- **Los Angeles** (5.5M $) and **New York City** (4.7M $) follow, likely owing to their large population density and economic activity.

## Data-driven Recommendations:
Based on the insights derived, it is recommended to capitalize on the festive season by strategizing marketing campaigns and product promotions. Additionally, efforts should be directed towards understanding consumer preferences to enhance product offerings and drive sales.

- Holiday Season Planning:
— Strategize targeted marketing campaigns and inventory management in the month of November for a expected surge in sales during the holiday season especially in **December**. Highlight popular high sales volume and revenue products and offer special discounts to boost sales.
- Apple Product Promotions:
— Align promotions and marketing efforts for Apple products, especially **MacBooks** and **iPhones** around **December** to maximize revenue during the year-end product release season.
- Product Diversification:
— Consider diversifying product offerings to include more high-margin items like the **Thinkpad Laptop** (4.1M $) while balancing revenue generation with high quantities and low-margin affordable products.
- Customer Engagement:
— Engage customers with loyalty programs or special offers on lower revenue generating months like **January** (1.8M $) and **September** (2.1M $) to boost sales.

These recommendations aim to optimize sales strategies based on the observed patterns, promoting revenue growth and customer engagement.
